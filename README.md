# Hey 👋🏻 

## About Me 😇
I'm a **Software Engineer** passionate about learning something new every day. My focus isn't on the tech I work with but on gaining a deeper understanding of how it works behind the scenes so that I can create my own stuff.  

## Tech Stack  
I work across both frontend and backend, but my area of interest is frontend. I specialize in React.js, Next.js, API Integration, Tailwind CSS, and more.  

## My Portfolio 🚀  
I also have a portfolio, and you can check it out here: [rumaisa.netlify.app](https://rumaisa.netlify.app).  

## My Blog ✍🏻  
Well, I'm also a writer. I love to document everything whenever I learn something new. I write articles in my free time to share my learnings about tech. I also share insights about my personal and professional journey. I write articles on both Hashnode and CoderLegion.
